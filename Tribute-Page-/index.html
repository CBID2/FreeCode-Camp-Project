    <p> In 2003, New York City music producers, Evan Rodgers and Carl Strucken took a spontaneous vacation to a little island called Barbados. While they relaxed on the beach, a 15-year old girl named Robyn Rihanna Fenty walked right up to them and sang to them. The two men were so wowed by her vocals and presence, they decided to record a few demos with to her to present to their bosses at Def Jam Records. Little did they know, this girl would go on to become the richest women in music. </p>
