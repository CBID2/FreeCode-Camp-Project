			<p> Born in the Barbados parish of Saint Michael in Feburary 20, 1988, Robyn Rihanna Fenty began honing her
				signature throaty, arresting vocals at an early age through listening to iconic talents like Madonna, Bob
				Marley, Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey. After signing with Def Jam Records, teenage Rihanna released her debut
				album, Music of the Sun in 2005 and her sophmore album, A Girl Like Me in 2006. The raving reviews about the
				albums' Caribbean-influence songs and Rihanna's "Girl-Next-Door" image has given her status as the Island Pop
				princess. But when Good Girl Gone Bad was released in 2007, Rihanna went from the cute Caribbean teen idol to
				today's Baddest "It-Girl" in Pop. In addition to releasing iconic albums, Rihanna added fashion and beauty
				icon to her resume when she debuted her inclusive-centric makeup and clothing line, Fenty Beauty in 2018, which
				eventually led her to becoming the richest female musician in 2021.</p>
