## Overview

### The challenge

- I had to build an app that is functionally similar to https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/

## My process
<!-- Do this section tomorrow -->
### Why this person?
- As a person who is transitioning into the Instructional Design field, I decided to a create a survey form for a mock organization.   
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties



### What did you learn from this project?
### Technique:
Through this project, I learned that it is ok to use div elements to create containers. On a personal note, I also found myself improving on using creative names for classes.

### Code Snippets:
<!-- Pick the HTML code line that you like the most -->
HTML

email validation
```
<label id="email-label"> Email Address</label>
<input type ="email" id="email-label" pattern ="[^ @]*@[^ @]*" placeholder="e.g. dantesmith@gmail.com">
```

CSS
<!-- Pick the code line that you like the most -->
resize
```
textarea {
  resize: none;
}
```




### Continued development
<!-- Mention Flexbox and that you want to add JS in the future -->
- CSS Flexbox
- More semantic HTML tags



### Useful resources
<!-- Pick 2-3 sources that stood out to you. -->
- [W3 Schools: How to create a Contact Form](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp) - This source gave a me few ideas on how to create the form and structure its textbox. I highly recommend it if you are struggling with using the div element to create a form's structure. 
- [FreeCodeCamp: CSS Button Style â€“ Hover, Color, and Background](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-button-style-hover-color-and-background/) - I found this article when I was struggling to style my button. It gave me some ideas on how to make my button appealing. If you're still learning this concept or need a refresher, I highly recommend reading this article.
